Problem Statement: Predictive Feature Identification for Loan Approval using Hypothesis Testing and Feature Engineering

In the context of a loan dataset, the goal is to identify key features that robustly predict whether an upcoming candidate is likely to be a good candidate for loan approval. The task involves employing hypothesis testing and feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

Objective:
To determine and create features that significantly contribute to predicting the creditworthiness of individuals applying for loans, using statistical hypothesis testing and innovative feature engineering.

Approach:

Hypothesis Testing:
Formulate hypotheses around various features that might influence the likelihood of a candidate being a good borrower.
Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to evaluate the significance of these features in predicting loan approval.
Identify features with statistically significant differences between approved and rejected loan applications.

Feature Engineering:
Analyze the existing features in the dataset and explore opportunities for creating new informative features.
Introduce relevant ratios, indices, or transformations that capture nuanced information about a candidate's financial profile.
Utilize domain knowledge to craft features that might highlight an applicant's creditworthiness.

Deliverables:
A well-defined set of features identified through hypothesis testing that significantly contribute to predicting loan approval.
New engineered features designed to enhance the model's predictive power.

Significance:
This project aims to enhance the accuracy and fairness of loan approval decisions by leveraging statistical testing and feature engineering. The outcomes will not only contribute to a more informed decision-making process but also provide insights into the factors influencing creditworthiness.
